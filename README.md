## Installation

The program will require and npm install. After the files are loaded the user will have to run the schema to generate the database needed. Then the user will run the seeds by executing node ./seeds/index.

## Usage

After the installation is completed the server will have to be spun up. This can be done by executing node server. Once the server is listening the user can use Insomnia to retrieve tags, categories, and products. The user can also use Insomnia to POST, PUT, and DELETE.
